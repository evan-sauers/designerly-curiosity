            <img class="leftImg" src="images/npr.png" style="width: 300px"><p>Over the course of the semester, I listened to a variety of NPR and American Public Media podcasts and stories. The podcasts that I particularly found the most interesting was the Ted Radio Hour. Within this show the episodes of “Why Is Laughter Contagious?” and “What Makes An Idea Go Viral?” were the most intriguing. I think the reason that I enjoyed this podcast the most was because it takes a simple question and dives into a grand scheme of answers through Ted Talks.</p>
            <p>I found the Ted Radio Hour “Why is Laughter Contagious?” absolutely fascinating. I love to laugh, especially with friends and family. I learned that we associate laughing with interactions and, more specifically, the action of play. We are 30% more likely to laugh with someone else rather than when alone. I believe that the build-up of laughter between two or more people can gain lots of momentum especially during those late night times when people tend to be more slaphappy. Going even deeper into the concept, humans laugh to show you agree with them or like the person you are laughing with. Another point that the speaker, Sophie Scott, made was that humans are good at recognizing what fake laughter and real laughter sounds like. </p>
            <p>The other Ted Radio Hour that I enjoyed was an episode titled “What Makes An Idea Go Viral?” presented by Seth Godin, an author and business executive. This podcast was about how some ideas are very remarkable, but are nothing without the correct marketing. The consumer needs to care or have a desire about the product you are marketing. Ironically, these two concepts of laughter and ideas are similar due to them both being contagious. The difference is that an idea wants to be intentionally contagious.</p>

            <h2>Observant #3 - Fort Wayne Police Department</h2><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p>On February 25, 2019 the computer information sciences department went on a department-wide field trip to the Fort Wayne Police Department. This field trip was meant to serve as a learning experience for the students to learn more about how technology effects the everyday aspects of the Fort Wayne Police Department. The all-day event was interesting and informational experience, and gave me the perfect opportunity to participate in an observant prospect for the Designerly Curiosity.</p><img class="rightImg" src="images/ftwayne.gif">
            <p>The environment was very solemn and reserved. There was very little noise and the soft lighting combined with the marble floors and high ceilings created a very professional and serious landscape. The hosts of the field trip giving the presentation, including the chief forensics officers was no different. In the way he spoke, it was a very serious occasion. The building was designed in a way that each door and floor had a clearance level to which it was assigned, meaning not everyone can go everywhere in the building. We needed a chauffeur to guide us through the forensics lab rooms and offices. During the tour, the students were required to keep our hands in our pockets at all times as they did not want our fingerprints on any items of evidence.</p>
            <p>In all, the trip was designed to be a learning experience, and it certainly was. I could tell there was a lot of intention in the work that the Fort Wayne Police Department participates in because it was very private as we were unable to see lots of places on the tour.</p>

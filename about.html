            <h3>The Designer</h3>
            <p>I am Evan Sauers, a senior at Indiana Wesleyan University in the Division of Mathematics and Computer Sciences. My major is Computer Information Systems with a Media Design minor. At Indiana Wesleyan University, I am currently employed as a student Web Developer, where I work with the Marking Department on the university undergraduate website. Some tasks include fixing faculty and staff requests, updating webpages, and creating new content and features.</p><p>I have a passion for website development/design and graphic design, as well as a great sense of organizational and detail-oriented skills that I hope to showcase in my future career.</p><br>
            <h3>The Assignment</h3>
            <p>As designers, we have a responsibility to pay attention to current and historical cultural trends. As professionals, clients will look to you - as the designer - to portray their organization as resonant, relevant, interesting, and culturally appropriate. In order to do this well, designers must have a deep knowledge of culture and the humanities (visual or otherwise). As a professional, the quest to be culturally relevant isn't something on which others will formally eva luate you. It's up to you to develop an ingrained curiosity to always be seeking new and interesting things, to understand the historical context, or to develop a desire to be a well-rounded global citizen.</p>
            <p>The DES-101-82B course is your first chance to develop designerly curiosity in a systematic way. By continuing your journey, you will continue to understand how to develop better cultural understanding and grow as a designer.</p><br><br><br><br>

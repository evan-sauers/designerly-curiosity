            <p>Back in 2015 during my freshman year, I went to the Five Points Mall down the Marion strip with a group of friends. Before going the first time, I had heard this mall had once been a Grant County hotspot; however, when I went it was not that impressive. This year, I decided to go back to the Five Points Mall with another group of friends for the Designerly Curiosity. When I went back, I made sure that I was extra observant of the environment, people, and overall space.</p>
            <p>The second time attending the mall was even more disappointing than the first time. I was surprised by the number of stores had gone out of business. The space had totally been run down. The floors were covered in dirt and dust, the entire environment felt very dirty and abandoned. I noticed lots of ceiling lights and tiles were out, and the population of people was sparse. There were many elderly people dressed in athletic clothing walking fast throughout the mall as an exercise routine, using the mall as a personal track instead of a shopping environment.</p>
            <p>The stores were very much run down, and the ones still in business were either going out of business soon or not very popular stores. After walking around the mall, I observed that there weren’t many people, stores, or shopping in general. There was no background music playing, just the sound of peoples’ tennis shoes squeaking on the floor and distant conversations. We were not there for very long at all as there was not much to do, and I expect that the other people present did not spend a lot of time at the mall either.

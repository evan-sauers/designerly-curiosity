            <p>One of the a la carte items included watching at least one Criterion Collection film that you haven’t seen before. After browsing the long list of films in the Criterion Collection, I decided to watch The Breakfast Club, which was released in 1985. I chose this movie because I had never seen it before, always heard that it was an instant classic from others, and witnessed many references to the film in other movies, television shows, and pop culture. From the beginning credits, I promptly noticed that this film feels like it had been preserved throughout history. The title screen of the yellow simple font against a black background felt iconic. There were many design aspects that I noticed throughout the film.</p>
            <p>The most recognizable design aspects in The Breakfast Club were the physical objects. From the cars their parents drove to the background setting of the library and the school lockers, the set had been designed to resemble a typical high school at that time. The outfits that the actors wore were clearly and carefully chosen to match the individual’s personality.

            For example, having the smart student wear a lighter more sophisticated look and having the rulebreaker student wear darker and dressed-down themes. The final takeaway of incorporated design was through storytelling. The film was written in a deliberate way that unfolded the characters to reveal who they are and how they got into detention. As the film progressed, each of the students’ problems were discovered. This fundamental and engaging way of planned design through storytelling made for an enjoyable classic film.</p>

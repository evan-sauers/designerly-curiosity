            <p>The day before Valentine’s Day, on February 13th, 2019, AIGA hosted their annual Valentine’s event. With Love, From AIGA is an event for art students to create and write Valentine’s Day cards for the Division of Art faculty and staff members. They host this event every year, however this year the cards were not made specifically to each faculty. Rather, we made general cards that could go to any faculty member. </p>
            <p>At the party, there were snacks and drinks, decorations, and even art-related word searches. I noticed that the AIGA members did a great job with having a consistent theme and logo for the event. The heart inside a message bubble was shown in the social media posts, overhead PowerPoint, and posters. Also, each table had a poll on whether a certain fruit or font is better than the other, which sparked some debates.</p>
            <p>During the card making process, the group that I was sitting with decided to look up common Valentine’s Day quotes, cards, illustrations, and puns. There were some pretty funny ones, as well as some I wouldn’t necessarily send to a professor. In my designs, I tried to have consistency in fonts and balance as far as the illustrations, which I saw in the examples online. Continuing with the overall feel of the party, there was some background music that wasn’t too loud, but soft enough to fit with the laid back theme of the night. After eating, voting in the polls, creating the cards, and talking, we handed our designs over to the leaders to create vectors in Adobe Illustrator and send out to the professors.</p>

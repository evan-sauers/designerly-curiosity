            <h2>Theatre - Chorale Performance</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p>On the weekend of March 23, 2019, Indiana Wesleyan University hosted Family Weekend 2019. As one of the events for parents and loved ones and also my theatrical performance requirement for the designerly curiosity, the IWU Chorale performed a small-scale concert in the Piazza of the Barnes Student Center.<img class="rightImg" src="images/chorale.jpg"> The event was designed in an interesting fashion. I had the opportunity for this event to sit high above so I could see not only the crowd, but also the Chorale singers. There were tables and chairs in which everyone sat at in the common area in a more relaxed environment. Before the concert they addressed this as a place “out-of-the norm” to get out of their comfort zone. The high ceilings and wide area still allowed their vocals to travel throughout the Student Center.</p>
            <p>Halfway throughout the performance, they changed their choreography. Instead of being directly in front of the audience, they all gathered in a large circle around the audience, while a group stayed at the forefront. This design allowed their voices to surround the audience for a different experience. They sang and provided musical instrumentals for seven or eight songs in total for the event. Most of the songs were about the peace of God and the peace that comes through death and life everlasting, including a song produced by Bach for his birthday this past week. As a whole, this unique concert was an enlightening event, that I would not have previously attended if it were not for the designerly curiosity project.</p>

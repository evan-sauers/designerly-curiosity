            <p>On Monday, January 14, 2019, I attended an opening and lecture for “Engraven Images”, produced by alumni Jake Sneath, at the 1920 Art Gallery. “Engraven Images” was culminative display of photography and art taken and created by Jake Sneath. The main piece was a set of photos created and scratched to reveal colors of a comet. In his lecture, he discussed the importance of this comet that might have answers about the origin of the universe. Rosetta, a satellite developed to study the comet crashed into the comet. Sneath profoundly stated that the thing it was created to study was ultimately destroyed by it. Other pieces at the opening included images of garbage taken on railroad tracks in Marion and candid pictures of his son and lightsabers. His goal with the gallery was to show themes of science fiction with actual science, and to show the magic that actually exists, such as in space.</p>
            <p>To expand upon Jake Sneath’s lecture with my personal insights, at first I did not see the connection, and was thinking of other aspects of distance and ordinary objects; however, after his lecture it became clear. Often I believe we see fiction, like lightsabers in the movies, and think about how amazing it would be if these pieces of fiction existed. However, there is so much science and magic that exists in creation, as Sneath showed through the comets. Even in everyday life, stopping to observe birds flying in a pattern or the way a vine stretches and twists up a branch is often overlooked by our schedules and demands. There is so much wonderment in ordinary things that we have been accustomed to, which Sneath’s children pieces revealed to me. Overall, the gallery opening showed that there is not a tremendous gap between science and science fiction. </p>

            <p>	One of the Designerly Curiosity A La Carte items is to watch either a biographical, critically-acclaimed, historical, political, or social and cultural documentary that I have never seen. I chose to watch the critically-acclaimed and award-winning documentary titled “The Pixar Story.” This documentary showed the evolution of animation and the uprising of the Pixar company. It perfectly merges the importance that technology inspires art and art drives technology. Computer animation was truly a revolution that had never been heard or thought of, and it was very inspiring to hear the story of this revolution that started from practically nothing.</p>
            <p>An aspect that I found interesting was the part about how the traditional hand-drawn animators feared computer animation. No traditional animators wanted to start computer animation because they thought it would take away their jobs. I think this is still a fear in many areas of study today. So much is moving towards technology, the “cloud”, artificial intelligence, and other aspects taking away traditional jobs such as traditional artists, receptionists, and machinists. Throughout the documentary, I witnessed tons of new ideas, and risks that were taken. Although there were so many hurdles and blocks, the workers and animators would spend countless hours and nights to get the job done, which is very inspiring. It was also interesting to know how Steve Jobs had a motivational and financial hand in developing Pixar. Overall, I enjoyed history behind many of the beloved films, including <i>Toy Story</i>, <i>Finding Nemo</i>, <i>A Bug’s Life</i> and <i>The Incredibles</i>.</p>
